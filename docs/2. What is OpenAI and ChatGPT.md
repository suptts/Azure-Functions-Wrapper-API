## เราสามารถให้ ChatGPT ทำอะไรได้บ้าง (มันทำอะไรได้มากมาย) เช่น

### 1. Answer simple question for example:
- What’s the difference between GitHub and GitLab?
- What’s the difference between GitHub and GitLab in 20 words or less?
- What’s the difference between GitHub and GitLab in a way that you would explain to non-technical or an 80 year old grandpa?

### 2. Business reason เช่นเขียน email
- Write a polite email to someone who have recently canceled their myIsusu membership to re-subscribe to the plan and they will receive 1,000 Thai baht off their membership
- Explain the character of electric vehicle if you were a salesman
- Write a polite email to end users to inform about the service outage of Internet service

### 3. Translation Services ด้วย ChatGPT
- Transform the following sentence into French, Japanese, and Thai: I’m so hungry
- Transform the following sentence into French, Japanese, and English: ฉันหิวมาก

### 4. Conversational capabilities คือการตอบโต้พูดคุยกับเราได้ 
- Give me example of a fruit
- Give me 5 more examples

### 5. Prompts and Response 
Promts ใน NLP หมายถึง ส่ิงที่เราส่งให้ model (what you give to the Model) and Response คือสิ่งที่ model ตอบกลับมา (what you get back)

### Prompts

Prompts are instructions on how you “program” the model. These language models are heavily dependent on reacting to good prompts. Garbage in = Garbage out

ตัวอย่างเช่น

`Write an exam to test a candidate's skill in Excel`

### Prompt optimization
- Be very instructional in what you want, and as specify as you want
- Provide examples with good quality data; show and tell the model how to respond
- Don’t rely on factual response (เพราะมันถูก trained มานานและข้อมูลที่ป้อน)

```
Write a multiple choice exam with 10 questions to test a candidate's skills in basic Excel skills like formulas and formatting. Each question should have 4 possible answers, with only 1 correct answer. Label the correct answer. For example:

1. What does the agv() functions in Excel do?
A. Average selected cells
B. Sums selected cells
C. Provides the median of selected cells
D. Provides the max of the selected cells
Correct Answer: A

```

### Tokens
Tokens are the “currency” on OpenAO’s GPT models. The models process text by breaking it down into smaller units called tokens.
- 1 token is approximately 4 characters
- 750 words = 1000 tokens
- Token = prompt text + completed (response) text 
- For GPT, max is 4,000 tokens, so 3,000 words
- $0.02 per 1,000 tokens ($1=37,500)
- Free trial usage of $18 ~ 675,000

### Temperature
A parameter from 0 to 1

Higher values แปลว่ามีความเสียงสูง (model will take more risks).
Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 for ones with a well-defined answer.
